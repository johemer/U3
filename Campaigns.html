            <div><h1>Campaigns</h1></div>
         <div><p class="presentation">In role-playing games, a campaign is a continuing storyline or set of adventures, typically involving the same characters. The purpose of the continuing storyline is to introduce a further aspect into the game: that of development, improvement, and growth (or degeneration) of the characters. In a campaign, a single session becomes a scene or an act within an overall story arc. At its inception, a campaign may or may not have a defined conclusion. A campaign by definition spans more than one session of play. Certain aspects of the game are nearly always constant throughout a campaign: the campaign setting, the players, and the gamemaster. The gamemaster for a campaign is said to run the campaign.</p>

           <div><p class="presentation">A one-shot DnD adventure follows the same rules of a typical DnD campaign, the only difference is that it is usually self-contained and only runs for one session. This means that you introduce a new story and characters for a predetermined amount of time with no intention of using them again in the future.</p>
